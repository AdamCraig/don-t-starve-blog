<p class="new-post-box static-page">Hey, I'm Wilson. I'm currently chilling in this crazy dimension where things are always trying to kill me. Luckily, there is an internet connection! I like to hang out with my pals Chester and Glommer. They keep me sane in this crazy place. I hang out with the pigs once in a while too. They smell though. My favorite thing about myself is my ability to grow an epic beard. Also, I use one tube of hair gel a day. Oh, wait... I think I hear hounds coming. Time to go!</p>
